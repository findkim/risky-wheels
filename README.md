## Where We Dropping Boys?!

[http://riskywheels.com](http://riskywheels.com)

Tired of dropping at the same spots? Got a dictator on your team that likes to call all the shots? Let's shake things up by randomizing the drop.

Why use this one over other sites? It includes _unnamed_ locations and has a blacklist feature to remove locations that your team is just terrible at or just flat out hate (ahem. Loot Lake).

_Core of the JS wheel is attributed to [Andrew Brampton](https://blog.bramp.net/post/2011/07/27/html5-canvas-lunch-wheel/) who wanted some fun deciding on lunch._ Thanks man!

### Upcoming Features
* Hover-over screencaps of unnamed locations (the names are just what the folks I play with commonly calls them -- suggestions are welcomed!)
* Weights: add increase chances of dropping to favorite spots
